## Project Overview

Welcome to the Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement project, a cutting-edge solution that revolutionizes security compliance in the age of data-driven complexity. As organizations like Flipkart grapple with escalating data volumes and intricate systems, ensuring adherence to security policies becomes a paramount challenge. Our project introduces an innovative approach, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate compliance monitoring and enforcement through advanced log analysis.

## Unique Features and Innovations

- **Leveraging LLMs for Security:** Harness the power of Large Language Models like GPT-2 to perform unparalleled log analysis. Our solution stands at the forefront of AI-driven security, utilizing natural language processing to identify non-compliant activities with astonishing accuracy.

- **Rule Definition and Inference:** Break free from manual rule-checking. Our project intelligently distills complex rules and infers relationships within logs and policies, enabling proactive security measures and insight-driven remediation.

- **Flexibility Across Environments:** Embrace the future of compliance monitoring with a system that adapts to diverse log formats, rule sets, and compliance standards. Our innovation ensures that your security solution remains versatile, whether you're dealing with CSV, text, or PDF logs.

- **Actionable Insights for Proactive Security:** We go beyond identification, providing actionable insights for quick and effective remediation. Uncover not just breaches, but the underlying causes, with recommendations that empower security teams to act decisively.

- **Scalable Performance:** In an era of data deluge, our solution shines with its efficient handling of large volumes of logs and text data. Maintain performance and accuracy as data scales, ensuring robust security compliance monitoring.
