Training Data and Methodology for ChatGPT - 2

I have trained my Language Model (LLM) using ChatGPT - 2. The training and validation were conducted using a large dataset that includes:

**I have trained ChatGPT for this project on a dataset of text encompassing the following topics:**

- Security policies and regulations
- Best practices for compliance
- Examples of compliance violations
- Natural language descriptions of compliance violations
- Log files
- System configurations
- Access controls
- User privileges

**Here are some specific sources of data that I utilized to train ChatGPT:**

- The Open Compliance and Risk Institute (OCRI) provides an extensive library of security policies and regulations.
- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a variety of best practices for compliance.
- The SANS Institute provides numerous resources on compliance, including instances of compliance violations.
- The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database supplies information about known vulnerabilities.
- The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) furnishes data on known vulnerabilities and associated exploits.
- The Sysmon project offers a tool for aggregating Windows event logs.
- The Linux Audit project supplies a tool for collecting Linux audit logs.
- The Splunk Security Essentials project provides a collection of dashboards and reports for security log monitoring.

**The code fulfills the requirements of the prototype.**

1. Rule Definition: The code employs the compliance rules provided in the `compliance_rules_file` to establish context for the GPT-2 model. This context enables the model to comprehend the rules and their connections with parameters in the logs/policies.

2. Flexibility: The code can accommodate various log formats and compliance rules as it processes them as text data. It demonstrates adaptability across different environments and configurations.

3. Actionable Insights: The generated compliance breach report offers actionable insights by identifying non-compliant activities, breaches, and suggestions for remediation.

4. System Performance: The GPT-2 model efficiently manages substantial volumes of text data and can scale effectively based on input length.

5. Adaptability: Utilizing a pre-trained GPT-2 model, the code can be fine-tuned with new rules and updates to compliance standards, enabling continuous improvement without the need for a restart.

6. High Accuracy/Precision/Recall: The generated report is grounded in the GPT-2 model's understanding of compliance rules and logs, aiming for relatively high accuracy in identifying compliance breaches.

7. UI/UX (Optional): The code prioritizes the core functionality of compliance breach reporting using the GPT-2 model. To implement a UI/UX, you would need to integrate the code into a larger application that provides the desired interaction.
