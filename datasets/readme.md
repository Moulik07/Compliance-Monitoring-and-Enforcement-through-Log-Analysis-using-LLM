I have used ChatGpt - 2 to train my LLM
For training and validation, i have used a large data set which includes,


** I have train ChatGPT for this project, I have train it on a dataset of text that includes the following:**

Security policies and regulations
Best practices for compliance
Examples of compliance violations
Natural language descriptions of compliance violations
Log files
System configurations
Access controls
User privileges

** Here are some specific sources of data that I have used to train ChatGPT:**

The Open Compliance and Risk Institute (OCRI) provides a comprehensive library of security policies and regulations.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a variety of best practices for compliance.
The SANS Institute provides a variety of resources on compliance, including examples of compliance violations.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database provides information on known vulnerabilities.
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides information on known vulnerabilities and their associated exploits.
The Sysmon project provides a tool for collecting Windows event logs.
The Linux Audit project provides a tool for collecting Linux audit logs.
The Splunk Security Essentials project provides a collection of dashboards and reports for monitoring security logs.






** My code FullFills the requirements of the protoype.**

1. Rule Definition: The code uses the compliance rules provided in the compliance_rules_file to create context for the GPT-2 model. This allows the model to understand the rules and their relationships with parameters in the logs/policies.

2. Flexibility: The code can handle various log formats and compliance rules since it processes them as text data. It's adaptable to different environments and configurations.

3. Actionable Insights: The generated compliance breach report provides actionable insights by identifying non-compliant activities, breaches, and suggestions for remediation.

4. System Performance: The GPT-2 model efficiently handles large volumes of text data and can scale well based on the length of the input.

5. Adaptability: As the code uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model, it can be fine-tuned with new rules and updates to compliance standards, enabling continuous improvement without restarting.

5. High Accuracy/Precision/Recall: The generated report is based on the GPT-2 model's understanding of compliance rules and logs, aiming to identify compliance breaches with relatively high accuracy.

6. UI/UX (Optional): The code focuses on the core functionality of compliance breach reporting using the GPT-2 model. To implement a UI/UX, you would need to integrate the code into a larger application that provides the desired interaction.
